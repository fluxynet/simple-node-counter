# README
Very simple proof of concept counter written in nodejs.
It counts views on a given path and on a given server, returning a json of current counter.

```
{
    all: 10, //for entire site
    path: 1 //for given path
}
```

The counter is either based on a redis backend or _simple_ mode in the application's memory.
Run with:
```
node app.js
```

Optional arguments:
--simple : Run without redis backend
--port 8888 : Run on port 8888
